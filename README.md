# Suppmed---Solution-Challenge-2024
Solution challenge suppmed application
Our aim in this application is to use artificial intelligence to remind people when they forget to take medicine in the busyness of daily life and also to teach them to use medicine consciously. You can also make an appointment with a doctor through our application. It asks the user to enter their chronic diseases, if any, and can make daily recommendations on this disease. In the future, the application will warn the user by immediately sending a notification when the user behaves in a way that will harm his or her chronic disease with the data it receives from any sensor. By using the Google map API, in case of any emergency, a notification will be sent to the user's nearest health institution and this situation will be displayed instantly from the application.
